 * Exec phase definition.

 * between base system and module.
 * In the init phase, the module's 'exec type' and 'trace selection mode' (see cseis_defines.h) have to be defined.
 * Also, any memory which need to be accessed during both the init and exec phase must be set ('variables' field).
 * In the exec phase, 
 * If the method isCleanup() returns true this indicates to the module's exec phase is completed. No traces are passed
 * in or out when this call is made. The module's exec phase subroutine should clean up any allocated memory and return.
